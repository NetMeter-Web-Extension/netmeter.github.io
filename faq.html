            <h3><strong>FAQ:</strong> Our Ongoing Efforts to Enhance Extension Accuracy and Website Support</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> How do you measure bandwidth usage for supported websites?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We measure bandwidth usage by examining multiple factors, including the
                "Content-Length" header in the response of each request made by the extension. This header provides
                information about the size of the content being downloaded. Additionally, we take into account the
                request payloads sent by users, which may include data submitted through forms or other interactions on
                websites. This comprehensive approach ensures that we provide an accurate measurement of both the
                content received and sent during your browsing sessions.
                <br>
                It's important to note that while we measure request payloads for bandwidth usage, we do not log or
                store any of the data contained in these payloads. Your privacy and data security are of utmost
                importance to us, and we do not collect or retain any sensitive information from your browsing
                activities.

                <strong>Q:</strong> Why are some websites not supported by your extension?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We are continually working to improve our extension's accuracy and expand its
                compatibility with a wide range of websites. However, due to the dynamic nature of the internet and the
                diverse structure of web pages, it can be challenging to support every website right from the start.
                Here are some common questions regarding this ongoing process:

            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> Why can't you support all websites immediately?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Supporting websites requires significant development effort to ensure our extension
                functions correctly on each site. We prioritize popular and frequently visited websites to provide the
                best user experience for the majority of our users. While we aim to expand our coverage, it may take
                time to support less common or niche websites.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> How can I request support for a specific website?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We value user feedback and encourage you to let us know about websites you'd like
                our extension to support. You can typically submit website requests through our Contact email in Chrome
                Extension page or Reviews. Your feedback helps us prioritize which sites to work on next.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> Are there any limitations in the types of websites your extension can support?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, there can be limitations. Websites with complex or unique structures may
                require more time and effort to support. Additionally, websites that frequently change their layout or
                content may experience occasional compatibility issues until we update our extension to accommodate
                these changes.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> How often do you update the extension to include new websites?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> We aim to provide regular updates to enhance the extension's website support. The
                frequency of updates may vary based on user feedback and the complexity of the websites we're working
                on. We appreciate your patience as we work to make our extension more comprehensive and accurate.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> What can I do if I encounter issues on a website that is not yet supported?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> If you encounter problems on a website that our extension doesn't support, you can
                try refreshing the site as this may help in some cases. Additionally, please report the issue to us, and
                we will do our best to address it in future updates. In the meantime, you can disable the extension if
                the extension is causing trouble accessing websites and browser.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q:</strong> Do you log my credentials or browsing history information when using this
                extension?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> No, we do not log your credentials or browsing history information when you use our
                extension. Your privacy and security are important to us, and we have designed our extension to respect
                your data and protect your online activity. We do not collect or store any sensitive information from
                your browsing sessions.
